WHILE FREEZE DRYING, AKA LYOPHILIZATION, IS OFTEN APPLIED TO THE DEHYDRATION OF HEAT-SENSITIVE CONSTITUENTS LIKE PROBIOTICS OR SOMETHING FOR HIGHER RESIDUAL VIABILITY (SANTIVARANGKNA ET AL., 2007), HOT AIR SPRAY DRYING (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS SPRAY DRYING) HAS DRAWN MORE ATTENTION THAN EVER THESE YEARS DUE TO ITS COST EFFICIENCY (PEIGHAMBARDOUST ET AL., 2011). NEVERTHELESS, POOR RESIDUAL VIABILITY CAUSED BY SPRAY DRYING REMAINS A PROBLEM THAT LIMITS ITS WIDESPREAD USE (MENG ET AL., 2008). THEN IT BECOMES CRUCIAL TO THE MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE DAIRY PRODUCTS TO SEEK MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE CELLS FROM HEATING AND DEHYDRATION AS WELL AS MAXIMAL PROBIOTIC VIABILITY AT THE DRYER OUTLET.
